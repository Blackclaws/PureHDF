/// <remarks>
/// An address can be referenced without ever being written to. A dataset created through
/// <see cref="H5File.BeginWrite(string, H5WriteOptions?)" /> has its payload allocated and named by its
/// layout message as soon as the structure is written, so a caller who never gets round to writing the
/// data leaves a region that everything points at and nothing has touched.
/// <para>
/// Whether that shows up as a broken file is decided by the placement, which is what makes it worth a
/// test of its own. An interleaved file tends to survive by accident: metadata is allocated after the
/// payload, and writing it extends the stream over the gap. A front-loaded file serves metadata from a
/// region at the front, so nothing extends the stream and it ends before the payload the layout points
/// at - which the HDF5 C library reports as "invalid dataset size, likely file corruption" rather than
/// as a short file.

    /// those a <see cref="H5WriteOptions.UserBlockSize" /> apart. Comparing them untranslated makes the
    /// file look long enough already and skips the extension, which is invisible until a user block is
    /// in play - so the zero case cannot stand in for the nonzero one.
    /// <para>
    /// 512 rather than something larger because that is the only user block size this library round-trips

    /// relatively, so it probes 512, 1536, 3584 rather than the 512, 1024, 2048 the format specifies, and
    /// only 512 lands. That is a reader bug of its own and nothing to do with placement.
